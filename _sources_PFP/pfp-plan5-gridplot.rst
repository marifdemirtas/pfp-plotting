Plan 5: Map a FacetGrid
========================

.. plandisplay:: plans.json
   :plan: Map Plot To Grid

After creating the subplots in the grid, each subplot is still empty and needs to be filled with bar plots to visualize the data within each category. This plan allows for all the sub plots to be mapped at the same time, without needing to go through each plot to choose the data.


Plan 5 - When to use this plan?
--------------------------------
After a multi-plot grid is initialized and you want to compare the relationship of categorial data across several subsets of the dataset.


Plan 5 - What parts can be customized to use this plan?
-------------------------------------------------------
Replace x and y values with the columns that you want to compare from the DataFrame, and palette to the other preset seaborn color schemes.
