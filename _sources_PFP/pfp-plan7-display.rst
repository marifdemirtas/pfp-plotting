Plan 7: Display Figure

.. plandisplay:: plans.json
   :plan: Display Figure

When you create a figure, you need to either visualize it or save it as an image file to be able to see it. 


Plan 7 - What parts can be customized to use this plan?
-------------------------------------------------------
